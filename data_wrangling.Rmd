```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readxl)
```

## Sheet codes
1 = catches
2 = indices
3 = age comps
4 = weight at age 
5 = maturity
6 = params
7 = Selectivity 
8 = Aging error

## Catches


```{r catches}
catch_raw<- readxl::read_xlsx("./Provided_Example/SuperSimpleParamsAndData.xlsx", sheet = 1)
#_Catch data: yr, seas, fleet, catch, catch_se
#            -999    1     1     0       0.01

n_rows<- nrow(catch_raw)
yr<- c(-999,seq(from = min(catch_raw$Year),to = max(catch_raw$Year), by = 1), -9999) # add years
seas<- c(1,rep(1, n_rows),0)
fleet <- c(1,rep(1, n_rows),0)
catch<- c(0,catch_raw$Catch,0)
catch_se<- c(0.01,rep(0.01, n_rows),0)

catch_formatted<- data.frame(cbind(yr,seas,fleet,catch,catch_se))
print(catch_formatted, row.names = FALSE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
